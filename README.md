# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Description

To practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I built a rock paper scissors game. I have always loved the idea of making games, so this was a fun first try at a basic classic. I learned a great deal about JavaScript by doing this project. If branches and simply seeing how logic is built into the code was valuable!
